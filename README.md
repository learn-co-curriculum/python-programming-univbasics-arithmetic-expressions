## Introduction

When we first introduced _expressions_, we presented a series of _operators_
and their corresponding _operations_ that were familiar from basic arithmetic:

|Operator|Operation|Note|
|--------|---------|----|
| `+` | Addition ||
| `-` | Subtraction ||
| `*` | Multiplication | We use `*` instead of `×` because it looks like `x`-the-letter|
| `/` | Division | We use `/` instead of `÷` because that's not on a keyboard|
| `**` | Exponentiation | We use `**` instead of `^` because that means something else in programming languages|
| `()` | Association | Expressions inside of `()` get evaluated earlier|

When we learned about these _operators_ and their part in _expressions_, we
didn't know how to use the _variable assignment_ and _variable lookup_
_expressions_ yet. We knew how _operators_ worked with _constant expressions_:
`5 + 1`. How do these expressions work with variables?

## Trace Resolution of Variables to Scalar Values to Return Value

In this section we're going to trace this expression of "variables" until we
get a return value. Consider:

```ruby
x = 5
y = 1
x + y #=> ???
```

Our mission is to calculate the value of adding `x` and `y`.

We know how to handle the first two lines: these are simple uses of the
_assignment expression_ which assigns two _scalar values_, `Integer` values to
the variables `x` and `y`:

```ruby
x = 5
y = 1
```

Let's consider what happens in the last expression, step-by-step


```ruby
x + y #=> ???
```

|Expression|Action|
|----------|------|
| `x + y`  | Variable lookup: `x`, resolves to `5`|
| `5 + y`  | Variable lookup: `y`, resolves to `1`|
| `5 + 1`  | Two constant, scalar, `Integer`s; apply `+` operation|
| `6`      | Addition produces `6`, no operators to apply, constant expression|

Similar logic follows for all of the basic arithmetic operators. While our
examples will use simple expressions with _operators_ and _values_ you should
try setting the numbers to _variables_ and enjoy experimenting in your
conversation with Ruby.

## Recognize `+` as the Symbol for Addition

Addition's symbol should look familiar. The symbol that is used to perform this
operation is (`+`).

## Demonstrate the Addition Operator

To get a feel for performing addition operations in Ruby, let's experiment. Open
up IRB by opening your terminal; type `irb` and hit enter and type the commands
below:

```ruby
10 + 1 #=> 11
```

```ruby
5 + -1 #=> 4
```

## Recognize `-` as the Symbol for Subtraction

Like addition, the symbol for subtraction (`-`) is also the same as in common
arithmetic.

## Demonstrate the Subtraction Operator

Let's experiment again. Open IRB and type these commands below:

```ruby
4 - 13 #=> -9
```

And don't forget that losing negative things is a positive!

```ruby
11 - -11 #=> 22
```

## Recognize `*` as the Symbol For Multiplication

The symbol for the multiplication is (`*`) so that we don't confuse it with the
letter `x`.

## Demonstrate the Multiplication Operator

Use IRB and try typing the following the multiplication commands:

```ruby
10 * 10 #=> 100
```

```ruby
11 * -11 #=> -121
```

If everything was typed correctly, your results should be `100` and `-121`.
Nothing out of the ordinary, right?


## Recognize `/` as the Symbol For Division

The symbol for the division (`/`) is a forward slash. There's no handy `÷`
character on most keyboards, so programmers adopted `/`.

***Division behaves differently in Ruby than you might expect***

Pay attention as we demonstrate it.

## Demonstrate the Division Operator

Open up IRB and try typing the following the division commands:

```ruby
8 / 3 #=> 2
```

```ruby
4 / 13  #=> 0
```

That's surprising! Just like in real life conversation, you can _express_
something that seems entirely innocent and get something very surprising back!
Maybe someone gets angry or becomes very sad. _Empathy_ is what lets us
recognize that something different is afoot with the person we're speaking to.
Let's try some _empathy_ with Ruby to understand why the _return values_ were
so surprising.

## Identify how division in Ruby differs from normal division

Now we just saw something a little bit strange, and it's related to "data
type," which we just learned about.

In Ruby, and most programming languages, numbers can be `Integer`s (whole
numbers), or `Float`s (decimal numbers). When you divide `Integers` by one
another, Ruby doesn't want to upset you by returning a non-`Integer`, it thinks
you're a "big picture" kinda thinker &mdash; "just stuff to the left of the
decimal, please."

It's a spot where our communication with Ruby can go wrong!

By the same reasoning as above, if _one_ of the numbers in the expression were
a `Float`, Ruby would get the hint that we want a precise answer, and it would
respond correctly.

```ruby
9.0 / 2 #=> 4.5
```

Take those "surprising" results from the previous section, make one, the other,
or both `Float`s and verify that you're back to conversing with Ruby as you'd
expect, using IRB.

## Conclusion

Wow that was amazing! We took three lessons to learn three expressions, but in
this lesson we added 4 more! We can now use IRB as a calculator &mdash; many
programmers keep IRB open when doing some mathematics...or when splitting the
bill for a lunch order.

Amazingly, our ability to "converse" with Ruby is on or about 2nd grade in the
US education system (7 years of age). We went from conversational "babies" to
basic school-children in 2 lessons! We're about to take another multi-year leap
by learning to be formal about logic: something that most humans don't get
skilled at until around 5th grade according to most psychologists (or 25 years
of age, according to most parents).
